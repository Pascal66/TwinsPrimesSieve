# Segmented Sieve of Zakiya (SSoZ)

This Java source file is a multiple threaded implementation to perform an
extremely fast Segmented Sieve of Zakiya (SSoZ) to find Twin Primes <= N.

Inputs are single values N, of 64-bits, 0 -- 2^64 - 1.
Output is the number of twin primes <= N; the last
twin prime value for the range; and the total time of execution.

Parameter tuning would be needed to optimize for other hardware systems (ARM, PowerPC, etc).

Fork this project from Github.
There's no external dependencies
 Run as Java application, and enter a N value when asked in console.

JAVA Example :
``` Please enter an range of integer (comma or space separated):
 0 2e11
 Max threads = 8
 generating parameters for P 13
 each thread segment is [1 x 65536] bytes array
 twinprime candidates = 9890110395; resgroups = 6660007
 each 1485 threads has nextp[2 x 37493] array
 setup time = 0.11 secs
 perform twinprimes ssoz sieve with s=3
 1485 of 1485 threads done
 sieve time = 30.229 secs
 last segment = 368551 resgroups; segment slices = 13
 total twins = 424084653; last twin = 199999999890+/-1
 total time = 30.339 secs
```
 NIM Example :
```

 200000000000
 threads = 8
 each thread segment is [1 x 65536] bytes array
 twinprime candidates = 9890110395; resgroups = 6660007
 each 1485 threads has nextp[2 x 37493] array
 setup time = 0.000000 secs
 perform twinprimes ssoz sieve
 1485 of 1485 threads done
 sieve time = 32.507 secs
 last segment = 368551 resgroups; segment slices = 13
 total twins = 424084653; last twin = 199999999890+/-1
 total time = 32.507 secs

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, create a plain Java project importing it, make sure that 'src' is the source folder of your project, and add the jars from the lib-folder to your classpath. 
You will need Java 8 or higher for the project to compile.
There is no documentation and no support, so you should be ready to start exploring the source code.
