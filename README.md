# Segmented Sieve of Zakiya (SSoZ)

This Java source file is a multiple threaded implementation to perform an
extremely fast Segmented Sieve of Zakiya (SSoZ) to find Twin Primes <= N.

Inputs are a range values N, of 64-bits, 0 -- 2^64 - 1.
Output is the number of twin primes <= N; the last
twin prime value for the range; and the total time of execution.

JAVA Example :
``` Please enter an range of integer (comma or space separated):
 0 2e11
 Max threads = 8
 generating parameters for P 13
 each thread segment is [1 x 65536] bytes array
 twinprime candidates = 9890110395; resgroups = 6660007
 each 1485 threads has nextp[2 x 37493] array
 setup time = 0.11 secs
 perform twinprimes ssoz sieve with s=3
 1485 of 1485 threads done
 sieve time = 30.229 secs
 last segment = 368551 resgroups; segment slices = 13
 total twins = 424084653; last twin = 199999999890+/-1
 total time = 30.339 secs
```
