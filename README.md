# Segmented Sieve of Zakiya (SSoZ)

This Java source file is a multiple threaded implementation to perform an
extremely fast Segmented Sieve of Zakiya (SSoZ) to find Twin Primes <= N.

Inputs are a range values N, of 64-bits, 0 -- 2^64 - 1.
Output is the number of twin primes <= N; the last
twin prime value for the range; and the total time of execution.

Computer used :
TOSHIBA SATELLITE L875-13D Core i7-3630QM@2.4Ghz 12Go(8+4) Ram DDR3 800Mhz

JAVA Example :
``` Please enter an range of integer (comma or space separated): 
0 2e11
 Max threads = 8
Using Prime Generator parameters for given Pn 13
segment size = 524288 resgroups; seg array is [1 x 8192] 64-bits
twinprime candidates = 9890110395 ; resgroups = 6660007
each 1485 threads has nextp[2 x 37493] array
setup time = 0.111 secs
perform twinprimes ssoz sieve with s=6
1485 of 1485 threads done
sieve time = 23.793 secs
last segment = 368551 resgroups; segment slices = 13
total twins = 424084653; last twin = 199999999890+/-1
total time = 23.904 secs
